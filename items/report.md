### Application Use Cases and or Examples

*[Provide use cases and examples of people using your application. Who are the target users of your application? How do the users use your application?]*

*Book search application*

*Targets Users:*
*Book enthusiasts, students, researchers, and anyone in need of finding specific book information.*

*Use Case Scenario:*
*Sarah is a college student working on her thesis. She is looking for books related to her research topic, "Climate Change and Sustainability." She opens the BookFinder app and enters the search query "Climate Change and Sustainability" in the book title search. The app provides a list of relevant books with titles, authors, publication years, and prices. Sarah selects a book, views its details, and decides to ask for recommendations in the app's chat system. She posts a message with the tag "Research Help," and within a few minutes, she receives a reply from Mark, a fellow student who suggests some additional books. Sarah finds this interaction helpful and gives Mark's reply a 'thumbs up' response, making it easier for other users to discover Mark's recommendations.*

*Features:*
1. *Title Search: Users can enter the book title in the app to search for specific book-related information.*
2. *Author Search: Users can search by the author's name to find all works by that author.*

## Code Design and Decisions



### Data Structures


*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *HashMap*
   * *Objective: Used to store book data efficiently for easy retrieval.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class DataBase](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/2dfbc550c2765f588d444cdbc9e952dd4057673b/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/database/DataBase.java#L36-38)*
   * *Reasons:*
      * *Efficiently store and organize book data for quick retrieval and filtering based on date and price criteria.*
      * *Populated during database initialization.*

2. *BPlusTree*
    * *Objective: Used for efficient indexing of book data.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [Class DataStructure](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/database/DataStructure.java)*
    * *Reasons:*
        * *More efficient than ArrayList for insertion with a time complexity of O(1).*
        * *Allows efficient search operations based on titles and authors by indexing words from book data.*

3. *ArrayList*
    * *Objective: Used for storing a list of books.*
    * *Code Locations: defined everywhere.*
    * *Reasons:*
        * *ArrayList is chosen for its dynamic sizing, making it suitable for storing a variable number of books.*

4. *HashSet*
    * *Objective: Used for storing unique book titles.*
    * *Code Locations: defined everywhere.*
    * *Reasons:*
        * *HashSet ensures that titles are unique, which can be important for certain operations.*

### Design Patterns

1.Singleton Pattern
   * Objective: used for storing book data and user message data for searching and messaging feature.
   * Code Locations: DataBase class: [DataBase](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/database/DataBase.java), UserManger class: [UserManager](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/backend/UserManager.java)
   * Reasons:
      * For DataBase class, we can load the whole book data from the json file to memory when the `getInstance` method is firstly called. This ensures the data are loaded only once as the book data in our app will not be changed. On constructing the single instance, the inverted index is created as well to enable fast search.
      * For UserManager class, singleton pattern ensures the user and message data loaded from Firebase is always up-to-date

2.Observer Pattern
   * Objective: used for update information displayed on UI when data changed on Firebase server.
   * Code Locations: ActivityObserver class: [ActivityObserver](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/backend/ActivityObserver.java), BlackListActivity class: [BlackListActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/frontend/BlackListActivity.java), HomeActivity class: [HomeActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/frontend/HomeActivity.java), MessageListActivity class: [MessageListActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/frontend/MessageListActivity.java)
   * Reasons:
     * To update information to display when data stored on Firebase changed. When user sends or delete a message of a user from blacklist, data stored in UserManager will be updated and call the `update` method of `ActivityObeserver`

3.Factory Pattern
   * Objective: used for generating new messages
   * Code Locations: MessageFactory class: [MessageFactory](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7572718/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/group/bookstore/backend/MessageFactory.java)
   * Reasons:
     Generating formatted Message instance. When there is no user to be sent to, return null and frontend will toast a message to inform the user there is no such user. Else, the factory will generate a formatted message of current date and time and send it to the receiver.

<hr>

### Parser

### <u>Grammar(s)</u>


 * *Design Grammar Method: The given grammar is designed to interpret search queries of bookstore, based on title and author. The process begins by   
   identifying basic components like title and author and then combine these components in high level rules. The design supports both single and 
   combined search terms using an AND operator, represented by a semicolon.*
   * *Advantages:*
      * **Simplicity**: The grammar allows for simple search queries, it is easy to use and user-friendly.
      * **Flexibility**: Users can search either by title, by author, or by a combination of both. This flexibility ensures comprehensive search 
      capabilities.  
      * **Recursive Design**: The use of recursion simplifies the representation, making the grammar more concise.
      * **Clarity**: Each parts is clearly defined, ensuring that the grammar can be understood and easy extended for developers.
   * *Grammar Related*
      * Interpreting search queries for bookstore.
      * Example: The grammar allows for queries like "@Tom;#Java" (Searching for an author named "Tom" AND a book titled "Java"),  "#programming" 
      (Searching for a book titled "programming"), and "@John" (Searching for an author named "John").

Production Rules:

    <exp>       ::= <term> AND <exp> | <term>
    <AND>       ::= ;
    <term>      ::= <title> | <author>
    <title>     ::= # <text>
    <author>    ::= @ <text>
    <text>      ::= <alpha> <text> | <alpha>
    <alpha>     ::= a | b | c | d | ... | y | z


### <u>Tokenizers and Parsers</u>


 * Tokenizers and Parsers Usage: They are used for processing and interpreting search queries of bookstore. Users can input queries to search based 
   on titles (prefixed with #) and authors (prefixed with @). These queries can be alone or combined using a semicolon ; . If not contains any symbol 
   like # or @, toknizer will make it as search on title. 
   * *Built Method:*
      * The Tokenizer class get the input text and give them a type, by identifying tokens based on specific prefixes and separating characters.
      Tokens related to titles and authors are identified by their distinct prefixes (# and @) respectively, and the tokenizer progresses to the next 
      token. 
      * The Parser class, parse on the tokens from the Tokenizer according to predefined grammar rules form a hierarchical structure. It checks 
      for valid tokens patterns and organises them into a structured format.
   * *Advantages:*
      * **Separation of Concerns**: By distinctly separating the tasks of tokenizer and parser, the system can handle changes in either component 
      without affecting the other.
      * **Flexibility**: Easy adapt to changes. If the syntax of a language is modified slightly, only a small part may need to be adjusted.
      * **Efficiency**: Algorithms are highly efficient, ensuring rapid processing of even large datasets.
      * **Clarity**: The use of clear prefixes and delimiters ensures that user queries are easy to write and understand.

### Others
We used Firebase to enabling sending message function as the database of Firebase can be automatically synced. When logged in, all user and message data are stored in UserManager class and add a listener method to sync with Firebase when the data change from Firebase. When some user tries to send message to another user, the data stored in UserManager class change and the upload method will be called to upload the changed local data to Firebase

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

1. *Bug 1:*
   - Login button can be clicked many times before login successfully,we should set it can only be clicked just one time during the loading time.
2. *Bug 2:*
   - As fuzzy search is used in our search activity, result may not be null if there is no requested result. e.g. the database will return some book containing the word "jay" when we try to search "java" as there is no exact word "java" or some word containing the substring "java" in our database.


<br> <hr>


## Testing Summary
1. Test of tokenizing and parser
   - Code: TokenizerTest and ParserTest Class, entire file for the Tokenizer class, entire file for Token class
   - Number of test cases: 21
   - Code coverage: All tests over 85% in Token and Tokenizer class
   - Types of tests created and descriptions: 
     - Tests in ParserTest include different types of tests for simple cases, complex cases, unsigned tokens, parsed letters, and illegal token exceptions. Their purpose is to verify the functionality and error handling of the Parser class to ensure that the parser correctly parses the input string and produces the expected output or exception.
     - Test cases for the Tokenizer class include the handling of input strings for delimiters, author tags, book title tags, and multiple tokens. Also included is a test case that verifies that the Token.IllegalTokenException exception is thrown in the presence of illegal tokens. These test cases are designed to validate the functionality and exception handling of the Tokenizer class to ensure that it correctly parses different types of input and generates the appropriate tokens.

2. Test of database and searching for different fields
   - Code: DatabaseTest in android test folder, entire classes in database package and Book class

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

We have established a well-defined conflict resolution protocol to ensure effective resolution of issues within our team during the course of our collaboration. The protocol includes procedures for situations such as (but not limited to):

- If a team member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines.
- If the group encounters issues, the procedure for reaching consensus or problem resolution.
- If a team member falls ill, the solution, or alternatively, the plan for mitigating the impact of unforeseen incidents during this 6-to-8-week project.

#### 1. Failure to Meet Deadlines

If a team member fails to meet project deadlines or deviates from the initial plan, the following steps will be taken:

- **Open Communication:** The team member must promptly inform the team, provide an explanation, and engage in a discussion on problem-solving.
- **Task Reassignment:** If feasible, tasks may be reassigned to other team members to prevent project delays.
- **Adjustment of Schedule:** If necessary, the project schedule will be adjusted to accommodate the new completion date.

#### 2. Internal Team Issues

In case of internal team issues, such as disagreements or collaboration difficulties, the following steps will be taken:

- **Open and Respectful Dialogue:** Team members are encouraged to engage in open, honest, and respectful dialogue to express their opinions and concerns.
- **Negotiation and Compromise:** Team members will make a joint effort to find compromise solutions to address the problem.
- **Involvement of Mentors or Organizers:** If issues cannot be resolved within the team, guidance and assistance will be sought from mentors or project organizers.

#### 3. Handling Illness

If a team member falls ill and is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, the following measures will be implemented:

- **Prompt Notification:** The team member who falls ill should immediately notify the team, provide a medical certificate, and estimate the expected recovery time.
- **Task Redistribution:** If possible, other team members may temporarily take over the ill team member's tasks.
- **Schedule Adjustments:** If necessary, project schedules will be modified to accommodate the member's recovery and return.

#### 4. Contingency Plan for Unforeseen Incidents

We have developed a contingency plan for unforeseen incidents to mitigate the impact of uncontrollable events during this 6-to-8-week project. This includes but is not limited to technical failures, unexpected events, and external disruptions.

- **Backup Plans:** We will create backup plans to address unexpected incidents and minimize their impact on the project.
